                 ``one size fits all'' paradigm for drug delivery is flawed.
                 Pharmacogenomics is the study of how human genetic information
                 impacts drug response, and it aims to improve efficacy and
                 reduced side effects. In this article, we provide an overview
                 of pharmacogenetics, including pharmacokinetics (PK),
                 pharmacodynamics (PD), gene and pathway interactions, and
                 off-target effects. We describe methods for discovering
                 genetic factors in drug response, including genome-wide
                 association studies (GWAS), expression analysis, and other
                 methods such as chemoinformatics and natural language
                 processing (NLP). We cover the practical applications of
                 pharmacogenomics both in the pharmaceutical industry and in a
                 clinical setting. In drug discovery, pharmacogenomics can be
                 used to aid lead identification, anticipate adverse events,
                 and assist in drug repurposing efforts. Moreover,
                 pharmacogenomic discoveries show promise as important elements
                 of physician decision support. Finally, we consider the
                 ethical, regulatory, and reimbursement challenges that remain
                 for the clinical implementation of pharmacogenomics.",

                 for new and uncharacterized anticancer drugs is important for
                 optimization of treatment efficacy. Current MoA prediction
                 largely relies on prior information including side effects,
                 therapeutic indication, and chemoinformatics. Such information
                 is not transferable or applicable for newly identified,
                 previously uncharacterized small molecules. Therefore, a shift
                 in the paradigm of MoA predictions is necessary toward
                 development of unbiased approaches that can elucidate drug
                 relationships and efficiently classify new compounds with
                 basic input data. We propose here a new integrative
                 computational pharmacogenomic approach, referred to as Drug
                 Network Fusion (DNF), to infer scalable drug taxonomies that
                 rely only on basic drug characteristics toward elucidating
                 drug-drug relationships. DNF is the first framework to
                 integrate drug structural information, high-throughput drug
                 perturbation, and drug sensitivity profiles, enabling drug
                 classification of new experimental compounds with minimal
                 prior information. DNF taxonomy succeeded in identifying
                 pertinent and novel drug-drug relationships, making it
                 suitable for investigating experimental drugs with potential
                 new targets or MoA. The scalability of DNF facilitated
                 identification of key drug relationships across different drug
                 categories, providing a flexible tool for potential clinical
                 applications in precision medicine. Our results support DNF as
                 a valuable resource to the cancer research community by
                 providing new hypotheses on compound MoA and potential
                 insights for drug repurposing. Cancer Res; 77(11); 1-13.

               so the utility of model systems rests on their ability to
               recapitulate the genomic aberrations observed in primary tumors.
               Tumor-derived cell lines have long been used to study the
               underlying biologic processes in cancer, as well as screening
               platforms for discovering and evaluating the efficacy of
               anticancer therapeutics. Multiple -omic measurements across more
               than a thousand cancer cell lines have been produced following
               advances in high-throughput technologies and multigroup
               collaborative projects. These data complement the large,
               international cancer genomic sequencing efforts to characterize
               patient tumors, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and
               International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). Given the scope

               amenable to high-throughput testing of therapeutic agents. Data

              of pre-clinical development yet it is also among the most
              complex, labor-intensive, and costly. This represents a major
              issue, as lack of proper target identification can be detrimental
              in determining the clinical application of a bioactive small
              molecule. To improve target identification, we developed BANDIT,
              a novel paradigm that integrates multiple data types within a
              Bayesian machine-learning framework to predict the targets and
              mechanisms for small molecules with unprecedented accuracy and
              versatility. Using only public data BANDIT achieved an accuracy
              of approximately 90\% over 2000 different small molecules -
              substantially better than any other published target
              identification platform. We applied BANDIT to a library of small
              molecules with no known targets and generated ~4,000 novel
              molecule-target predictions. From this set we identified and
              experimentally validated a set of novel microtubule inhibitors,
              including three with activity on cancer cells resistant to
              clinically used anti-microtubule therapies. We next applied
              BANDIT to ONC201 - an active anti-cancer small molecule in
              clinical development - whose target has remained elusive since
              its discovery in 2009. BANDIT identified dopamine receptor 2 as
              the unexpected target of ONC201, a prediction that we
              experimentally validated. Not only does this open the door for
              clinical trials focused on target-based selection of patient
              populations, but it also represents a novel way to target GPCRs
              in cancer. Additionally, BANDIT identified previously
              undocumented connections between approved drugs with disparate
              indications, shedding light onto previously unexplained clinical
              observations and suggesting new uses of marketed drugs. Overall,
              BANDIT represents an efficient and highly accurate platform that
              can be used as a resource to accelerate drug discovery and direct
              the clinical application of small molecule therapeutics with

                 address this problem, we developed CRAFTT, a computational
                 drug-repositioning approach for targeting TF activity. CRAFTT
                 combines ChIP-seq with drug-induced expression profiling to
                 identify small molecules that can specifically perturb TF
                 activity. Application to ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets revealed
                 known drug-TF interactions, and a global drug-protein network
                 analysis supported these predictions. Application of CRAFTT to
                 ERG, a pro-invasive, frequently overexpressed oncogenic TF,
                 predicted that dexamethasone would inhibit ERG activity.
                 Dexamethasone significantly decreased cell invasion and
                 migration in an ERG-dependent manner. Furthermore, analysis of
                 electronic medical record data indicates a protective role for
                 dexamethasone against prostate cancer. Altogether, our method
                 provides a broadly applicable strategy for identifying drugs
                 that specifically modulate TF activity.",
